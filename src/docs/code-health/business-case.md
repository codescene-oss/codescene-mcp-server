# The Business Case for Code Health

Rather than treating code quality as an abstract ideal, Code Health exposes its **business impact**: wasted effort, increased risk, and declining delivery performance.
CodeScene developed the Code Health metric using formal and peer-reviewed research. Code Health is the only code-level metric with a proven business impact.

## Code Health impacts Speed and Bugs

The research presented in [Code Red: the business impact of Code Quality](https://codescene.com/hubfs/web_docs/Business-impact-of-code-quality.pdf) 
analyzed code quality across large enterprises, categorizing code as Green (high quality), Yellow (moderate technical debt), and Red (severe technical debt). 
The results reveal a stark contrast in performance:

* *Speed*: On average, developers complete tasks in Green code more than twice as fast as in Red code.
* *Defects*: Red code introduces 15 times more defects than Green code, while Yellow code comes with four times more defects.
* *Uncertainty*: Modifying Red code is a gamble, as tasks can take up to nine times longer compared to Green code, which has far less variation in task completion times

Further, recent evidence show that Code Health is an important factor in AI-readiness. AI ready code has an optimal Code Health level of 10.0. 
Such code is optimized for both human and AI comprehension, limitting the AI break rate.

The differences between these three categories mean that we can turn Code Health into a tangible attribute for the business. 
Refactoring Red code comes with the following benefits:

* **Speed-to-market**. Healthy Green code allows you to ship features twice as quickly.
* **Delivery precision**: Healthy code lets you reduce the uncertainty in task completion times. You improve the delivery precision, simplifying coordination across the whole   organization. Suddenly, your marketing and sales people will be able to plan their activities with greater efficiency.
* **Unplanned work**: A reduction in post-release defects translates into improved product maturity. Fewer defects also means fewer context switches for your team: there’s simply less unplanned work and, hopefully, fewer pages in the middle of the night.
