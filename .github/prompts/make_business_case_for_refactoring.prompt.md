description: Run CodeScene's MCP tool for estimating the ROI when refactoring a source file.
tools:
  - code_health_refactoring_business_case
---

Make the business case for refactoring a given file/hotspot so that its Code Health improves. 
Use **CodeScene MCP Server** with the tool **code_health_refactoring_business_case** in order to 
get a data-driven and research based estimate on the business benefits.

* Present the business case as a simple summary that I can discuss with my team and Product Manager.
* Keep the business case brief -- maximum two paragraphs. Format it for readability.
* Based on the **code_health_review**, also add a paragraph estimating how much time it would take to perform the refactorings.
